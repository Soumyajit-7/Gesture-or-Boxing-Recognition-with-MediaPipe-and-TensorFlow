# Gesture-or-Boxing-Recognition-with-MediaPipe-and-TensorFlow

This project demonstrates real-time gesture recognition using MediaPipe and TensorFlow. The code captures webcam input, processes it with the MediaPipe holistic model, and trains a LSTM-based neural network to recognize specific gestures. The recognized gestures are then displayed in real-time, forming a sentence based on the user's hand movements.

## Features

- Real-time gesture and Boxing movement and Punches recognition using the MediaPipe framework.
- LSTM-based neural network for sequence recognition.
- Continuous display of recognized gestures forming a sentence.

## Requirements

Make sure to install the required libraries before running the code. You can use the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

git clone https://github.com/Soumyajit-7/Gesture-or-Boxing-Recognition-with-MediaPipe-and-TensorFlow.git
cd Gesture-or-Boxing-Recognition-with-MediaPipe-and-TensorFlow
pip install -r requirements.txt
